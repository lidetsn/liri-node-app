# liri-node-app

LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `concert-this` <'artist name'>
           #return the following info
                * Name of the venue
                * Venue location
                * Date of the Event

   * `spotify-this-song` <'artist name'>
          #return the following info
            * Artist(s)
            * The song's name
            * A preview link of the song from Spotify
            * The album that the song is from
   * `movie-this` <'movie-name'>
    # return the following info
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
   * `do-what-it-says`
           in this case it reads the parameters from the randon.txt file
then it takes the scond parameter ,it can be artis name, song name
 In addition to logging the data to the terminal/bash window, the liri output the data to a .txt file called `log.txt`.

  I included the screenshot of the output from the terminal/bash window to show the app is working as intended
   enjoy
